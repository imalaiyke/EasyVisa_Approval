## 🧠 Context

Businesses in the United States face growing demands for human resources, but finding the right talent is a constant challenge. 🏢👨‍💼👩‍💼

The **Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)** allows foreign workers to work in the US temporarily or permanently while protecting local workers from wage impacts. The **Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC)** processes job certification applications for employers. 📑🏛️

OFLC ensures that employers comply with statutory requirements when hiring foreign workers, helping to fill workforce shortages while maintaining fair wages. 💼💵

## 🎯 Objective

In **FY 2016**, OFLC processed **775,979 employer applications** for nearly **1.7 million positions**, marking a **9% increase** from the previous year. 📈

With the rising number of applicants, manual review has become tedious. OFLC has partnered with **EasyVisa** to create a machine learning solution to:
1. Shortlist candidates with higher chances of visa approval. 🏆📋
2. Recommend whether a visa should be certified or denied based on significant influencing factors. 🧐✔️❌

This project provides data-driven solutions to streamline visa approvals and help businesses find qualified foreign talent more efficiently. 🔧📉
